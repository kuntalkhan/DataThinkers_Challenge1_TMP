üîç Key Insights & Findings

Our analysis of the OmniMart dataset lead to the following key insights:

   1. Majority of customers are in the 18‚Äì25 age group, showing a younger customer base.

   2. Campaigns targeting women may help in balancing customer acquisition. Alternatively, male-focused products/services might already be driving the customer base.

   3. Products and services should be priced and designed for the medium-income segment, with some budget-friendly options for low-income groups. High-income group is   smaller but could be targeted for premium offerings.

   4. The USA should remain the primary focus market, but there‚Äôs strong potential to expand in the UK and Germany.

   5. Electronics is the most popular category (~69,000 purchases), indicating strong customer demand for tech products.
